        "technical_project": "I've always loved working on a project where I could combine my passion for retail and design! For a school project, I created a minimalist e-commerce platform using React and PostgreSQL, focusing on a sustainable fashion brand. I designed the UI/UX in Figma, and built a backend to manage products and orders. The best part was seeing how my design skills and coding skills came together to create a user-friendly experience. Even though it was a challenge, it was so satisfying to receive feedback from classmates and professors, and hearing that the app could be something that real people would use.",
        "future_excitement": "As I reflect on my goals for the next decade, I'm thrilled to think about contributing to the development of revolutionary technologies that have the potential to transform the world. In particular, I'm eager to focus on the intersection of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and retail.

She'd often forget to take her meds or appointments, and it was stressing me out. I taught an old Alexa to recognize her voice and reminders. It was a huge win for me (and Grandma!) when I saw her responding to voice commands and feeling more independent. Tech-wise, it was a great experience working with Python and Alexa's SDK. Non-tech-wise, it was an awesome reminder of the impact tech can have on people's lives.",

I'm excited to dive into machine learning, data visualization, and explore new technologies - it's going to be an amazing experience!",
        "technical_project": "I'm a big fan of side projects! Lately, I've been dabbling in iOS development, and I built an app that helps customers track their shopping habits at local thrift stores. I used Swift and integrated it with a custom backend on AWS Lambda. The app uses barcode scanning to track items and generate personalized recommendations based on user preferences. What I enjoyed most was experimenting with data visualization to represent shopping trends and item relationships. It's still a work in progress, but it's awesome to see something I created have a real-world impact!",
        "future_excitement": "I'm thrilled to share my ambitions! In the next 10 years, I'm passionate about creating a sustainable e-commerce platform that leverages machine learning and data visualization to promote socially responsible consumption habits. Imagine an online shopping experience that not only recommends products based on user preferences but also encourages conscious purchasing decisions by displaying environmental and social impact metrics. By integrating machine learning algorithms with data visualization tools, we can inspire customers to make informed choices that benefit both themselves and the planet. This platform would be a game-changer for reducing carbon footprint and promoting a more mindful consumption culture.",

I designed a system that would use a combination of machine learning algorithms and environmental sensors to detect my morning routine and wake me up during a light sleep phase. I enjoyed combining my love for programming, electronics, and quantum mechanics to create something practical yet fascinating. It was a great experience working on a project from scratch, experimenting, and refining my code - it really taught me the value of patience and perseverance!",
        "future_excitement": "As I gaze into the technological crystal ball, I'm thrilled to think about the advancements I'll be a part of in the next 10 years. I'm eager to delve into the realm of quantum communication, where I envision secure, ultra-fast data transmission revolutionizing the way we connect and share information. Imagine a world where data is transmitted via entangled particles, enabling virtually unhackable communication. I dream of contributing to this technology, shaping the future of international diplomacy, commerce, and, of course, the internet. The prospect of bridging global connections with unbreakable encryption is what gets me truly pumped!",

It was my first time working with natural language processing (NLP), and I loved exploring how to make my device recognize my voice commands. The result? I can now have my music production setup and playlists ready to go with just a few voice commands.",

Imagine being able to explore 3D models of city architecture while walking through the streets, or virtual whiteboards coming to life in meetings - the possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to shape them!",
